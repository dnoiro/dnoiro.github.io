    <p>Hi! My name is Daniel as you already probably know. I'm currently a student at Clemson University studying
        Electrical Engineering. I was born and raised here in South Carolina in a small town with a population of about
        10,000 people. I have an older brother and a younger sister. My family and I have 3 dogs, Cookie, Tarzan, and
        Tobi.<br>
