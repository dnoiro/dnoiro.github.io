# Projects<br>

## Welcome to my project portfolio, where I display a broad spectrum of personal and collaborative projects developed during my college career. Here, you will find a rich collection of work that underscores my ability to creatively tackle complex engineering challenges.<br>

### Behavioral Modelling of Phase-Locked Loop using Deep Learning Techniques (MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project) ðŸ’»ðŸ”’<br>
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based behavioral model for Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs), which are crucial in many electronic systems. Despite their complexity and the intricacies involved in their simulation, this model aims to streamline the estimation of key performance metrics such as lock time, phase noise, and operating frequency without detailed component design. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the project seeks to create a model that is both abstract for speed and detailed enough to account for non-ideal PLL effects. The process includes generating and training on data from a simulated PLL environment, ensuring that the model can accurately predict PLL behavior under various conditions, thus accelerating mixed-signal design and **reducing time-to-market for semiconductor products**.<br>

### Space Flight Design Creative Inquiry ðŸš€<br>
The Space Flight Design project, conducted by a multidisciplinary team of engineers at Clemson University, focused on launching a rocket equipped with environmental sensors to study atmospheric conditions at varying altitudes. This initiative aimed to gather data on temperature, pressure, humidity, and other essential atmospheric metrics during the flight. The project not only showcased the practical application of engineering skills but also provided significant insights into environmental and atmospheric science.<br>

### Graph Models of Electric Power Transmission Network âš¡<br> 
> [!NOTE]
>This project began as a class assignment but never worked correctly, so now I'm personally creating it from scratch.<br>

This project is an initiative designed to enhance the operational reliability of modern power systems through advanced graph modeling techniques. Utilizing Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data, the project focuses on constructing a comprehensive Transmission Network Graph Model (TNGM) that optimizes power transmission and system monitoring. This effort integrates discrete particle swarm optimization (IPSO) for effective network mapping and includes the development of a smart visualization tool to aid system operators. The project aims to provide a robust solution for managing and controlling power grid systems, ensuring efficient and secure energy distribution across diverse geographical landscapes.
