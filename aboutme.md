# Who Am I?
**Hey there! I’m Daniel, and I’m a student at Clemson University, studying Electrical Engineering🐅⚡️. I’ll be graduating in May 2025. I was born and raised in a small town in South Carolina. I have an older brother and a younger sister. We also have three dogs: Cookie, Tarzan, and Tobi. And lastly, we have a loving (sarcasm alert!) bull named Canelo (Spanish for cinnamon).**<br>
