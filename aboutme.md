# Who Am I?
**Hi! My name is Daniel! I'm currently a student at Clemson University🐅 studying Electrical Engineering. I'm set to graduate in May 2025. I was born and raised in South Carolina in a small town with about 10,000 people. I have an older brother and a younger sister. My family and I have three dogs: Cookie, Tarzan, and Tobi. Finally we have a loving(add sarcasm) bull named Canelo(spanish for cinammon).**<br>
